HELLO! Welcome to our first web dev workshop of the quarter! I hope to use
this time every week to really just experiment with frontend languages and 
grow our skills together. I am here to learn from you, too!!

This is where you can submit your code for pubic version control so that other
members of the club can see what you have done! It is not a requirement that 
you put your work here, but it is always cool to have a record of what people 
in the club have done!

I'm excited to embark on this journey with you!!
